## Executive Summary:
1.  Project Objective:
•	The primary objective of this project is to develop a Bitcoin Prediction Model specifically designed for cryptocurrency markets.
•	By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, our goal is to create a robust framework capable of making informed trading decisions in the rapidly evolving     cryptocurrency landscape.

## Project Overview:
This project aims to analyze and predict cryptocurrency prices and blockchain activities using machine learning techniques, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The data includes various metrics related to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin, as well as blockchain activity and mining data.
The project overview outlines following factors that were considered when when accessing cryptocurrencies as  potential asset evaluation for the Bitcoin Model.

1. Growing Popularity and Volatility:
   •	Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others, have gained immense popularity in recent years, attracting investors and traders worldwide.
2. Need for Advanced Techniques:
   •	Traditional trading approaches may not suffice in the highly dynamic and unpredictable cryptocurrency markets.
3. Importance of Tailored Strategies:
   •	Cryptocurrency markets exhibit unique characteristics and behaviors compared to traditional financial markets.
   •	Therefore, developing model predictability tailored specifically for cryptocurrencies is essential to account for their distinct dynamics and optimize trading performance.

## Data Selection and Metrics Scope:
Coinmetrics is selected for its robustness and reliability in providing comprehensive cryptocurrency market data.
•	The platform offers a wide range of metrics and indicators, allowing for in-depth analysis and modeling of cryptocurrency price movements.
•	Coinmetrics' reputation for data accuracy and integrity makes it a trusted source for building predictive models and making informed trading decisions.
•	Its API and datasets provide convenient access to historical and real-time cryptocurrency data, facilitating seamless integration into the project's workflow.

Coinmetrics provides various data metrics related to cryptocurrencies, including but not limited to:
1. Price Metrics: Such as open, high, low, close prices, and trading volume.
2. Network Metrics: Including hash rate, difficulty, and block size.
3. Transaction Metrics: Such as transaction count, transaction volume, and average transaction value.
4. Mining Metrics: Including miner revenue, miner fees, and block rewards

These metrics provide insights into various aspects of cryptocurrency networks and their ecosystems, enabling analysis, research, and decision-making for traders, investors, researchers, and other stakeholders.

Additional Date Availability CoinMetrics is comprosed of multiple metrics grouped into the following categories:
- **Basic Price Information**: Prices of BTC, ETH, and DOGE in USD.
- **Blockchain Activity Metrics**: Active addresses, transaction count, value, block difficulty, and total fees in USD.
- **Mining and Revenue Metrics**: Mining revenue, hash rate, hash price, and Bitcoin held by miners.
- **Market and Economic Indicators**: SOPR, MVRV Ratio, and Rev. Puell Multiple.
- **Volatility and Network Flows**: Realized volatility over different periods and netflows from/to exchanges.
- **Lagged Price Data**: Historical price data for time-series analysis.

## Project Goals:
1. Developing Machine Learning Models:
   - Our primary goal is to develop machine learning models capable of accurately predicting cryptocurrency price movements.
   - Leveraging historical price data and relevant market indicators, we aim to train sophisticated models, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to forecast future price trends with high precision.

2. Implementing Ensemble Methods:
   - In addition to individual machine learning models, we intend to implement ensemble methods to further enhance prediction accuracy and robustness.
   - Ensemble methods combine the predictions of multiple models to produce a collective forecast that often outperforms any single model. By integrating diverse          perspectives and approaches, ensemble methods can effectively capture the complexity of cryptocurrency markets.

3. Optimizing Trading Decisions:
   - Beyond prediction, our project seeks to optimize trading decisions in the cryptocurrency market.
   - By integrating machine learning predictions with sophisticated trading algorithms, we aim to maximize returns and mitigate risks associated with cryptocurrency trading.
   - Through systematic analysis of market signals and adaptive decision-making, our goal is to develop a trading strategy that capitalizes on opportunities while minimizing potential losses.

4. Maximizing Returns and Mitigating Risks:
   - Ultimately, our overarching goal is to maximize returns for investors while simultaneously mitigating risks inherent in the cryptocurrency market.
   - By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques and ensemble methods, we aspire to achieve a balance between profitability and risk management, thereby delivering value to our stakeholders.



## Steps

### Step 1: Data Collection
- Data is sourced from various reliable crypto analytics platforms.

### Step 2: Data Preprocessing
- Includes cleaning, handling missing values, outlier detection, and feature engineering such as timestamp decomposition and rolling window statistics.

### Step 3: Model Building and Evaluation
- Using LSTM networks to capture temporal dependencies within the data.
- Models are evaluated based on their prediction accuracy and ability to generalize using time series cross-validation.

### Step 4: Implementation of Boosted LSTM
- Boosting technique is applied to LSTM to enhance model performance by focusing on the residuals of previous models.
