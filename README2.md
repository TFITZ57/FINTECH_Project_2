# Fintech Machine Learning Price Prediction Model

This project aims to develop an algorithmic trading strategy that uses machine learning to learn and adapt to changing market conditions, optimizing trading decisions for maximum returns. The model will predict the next hour or day's closing price for a given financial asset based on historical data, and provide recommendations on whether to buy, hold, or sell the asset.

## Data Sources

The project utilizes data from the following sources:

- Financial data
- Exchange data
- Economic data

These data sources are accessed through the CoinGecko API, for which the team has an Enterprise plan with a student discount (https://www.coingecko.com/en/api).

## Approach

The project employs various machine learning techniques and models to accurately predict future prices. The primary models and techniques used include:

- Regression models
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models
- Boosting models (which have shown promising results)

## Tools and Technologies

The project is implemented using the following tools and technologies:

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- TensorFlow
- Seaborn (for data visualization)
- hvPlot (for interactive visualizations)

## Installation and Usage

To run this project, you will need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (version 3.6 or later)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- TensorFlow
- Seaborn (optional, for data visualization)
- hvPlot (optional, for interactive visualizations)

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies in your terminal or command prompt.
5. Open the relevant Jupyter Notebook file(s) and run the cells to train the model, make predictions, and visualize the results.

## Examples and Results

The project notebook(s) contain examples of the application, as well as the results and summary of the analysis. These include visualizations of the historical data, model training and evaluation metrics, and predictions for future prices along with the corresponding buy/hold/sell recommendations.

Additionally, screenshots showcasing the application and visualizations will be included in the project repository.
